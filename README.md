To run this program, first install Python3 or higher versions, and install packages that are needed in the program: numpy, scikit-image, scipy, panda, matplotlib, opencv. If the system used is MacOS, you can use either pip or brew to install the packages. It is recommended to install the packages in a virtual environment, which creates separate paths and interpreter for the program and does not interfere with your own system files. You can first install the virtualenv package, and use mkvirtualenv to create a virtual environment, and use pip install commend to install all the above packages.

After installing the packages, you can press run by pressing Run in Eclipse, and the program should run and show a sample image of the logo contours collected, and also print out the prediction results as well as the accuracy. 

If there is any problem with loading the image, you can try and change the path of the images into absolute path of the images in the computer that is was downloaded in.

You can delete the # in the last line and see the printed result.
 
If you want to see the extracted contour images, you can delete the # on line 50 and 51, and the images of
the logo contours will be shown in a window.
